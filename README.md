# Frank's Famous

Frank's Famous is an extension of [Pizza Man](https://github.com/kripy/pizza-man), bringing in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) support via [Sinatra Support](https://github.com/sinefunc/sinatra-support/), [HTML5 boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) support via [Compass H5bp](https://github.com/sporkd/compass-h5bp), and asset management via [Sinatra AssetPack](https://github.com/rstacruz/sinatra-assetpack). Phew. 

Again it's a Heroku ready [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) app, running on [Unicorn](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/) with  [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) for templating.

Check the code for the only real gotcha I came across, with Heroku seemingly not being able to deal with asset minification yet the assets were minified anyhow. Go figure.

I also added an extra helper to load [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) before the HTML body start tag, as per the HTML5 boilerplate convention, with the rest of the JavaScript includes loading right before the end body tag.

## Installation

Firstly, make sure you've [installed Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). Also, install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) as it includes [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) for running Procfile-based applications.

Then in terminal, clone me:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kripy/franks-famous my-franks-famous
$ cd my-franks-famous
$ foreman start
```

Open up a browser at ```http://localhost:5000/```: now you're cooking!

## Deployment

If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account. Everything you need to know and do to deploy is in [Getting Started with Ruby on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby).

In terminal, cd into your app:

```
$ cd my-franks-famous
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "init"
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
```

Then enjoy your slice of pizza pie!
